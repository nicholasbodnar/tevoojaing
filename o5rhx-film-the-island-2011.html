                            <p> Hello (https://imgur.com/TrrXCLO), if you are just joining us, this is a rapidly evolving situation. ## However, you can read past information here up to present, in this timeline thread. It will be updated with the live threads concurrently. (https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/b0isrw/timeline_of_burning_sun_seungri_jung_joon_young/?) Keep in mind that some of the content discussed involves drug use, and extreme sexual violence. It is not detailed in this post, however, some links Dean Corll, the Candyman of Houston. Together with David Owen Brooks, and Elmer Wayne Henley Jr, he killed 28 known boys between September 1970 and August 1973. On August 8th, 1973, his reign of terror came to an end when he was shot by Henley, when he tried to turn on Henley and murder him. It's known that he inspired John Wayne Gacy. He was extremely sadistic, and loved sexual mutilation, such as biting off their penises, and completely removing their testicles. He even had to wear an apron. I have the following for trade.

While the others did whatever they were doing, Jill, a little girl of 5, became fascinated with the flutterbyes and no one noticed her chasing after them into the woods.

Hi, my beloved truelesbians. Following an idea sparked by a comment from u/vistarmonei, I decided to put together a list of lesbian related films. A Lesbian Movie Database of sorts, or LMDB, if you will. :) I've listed the films alphabetically and included a link to the IMDB entry for each. I've tried to keep the blurbs spoiler-free. Some of these films have only marginal connections to lesbians, like _Mulholland Drive_, but I felt they should be included. In some cases, the characters could. The year is 1998. Marvel, having sold film rights to many of their characters in the early 90s, were frustrated that no films had yet arrived. Most of these deals were 7 years old, and were going to expire soon. FOX was approaching them for renewal of the deal. (https://web.archive.org/web/20180626082737/https://variety.com/1999/film/news/marvel-fox-pact-for-pix-1117491127/) Meanwhile, SONY was about to sue, claiming that they still had rights to Spider-Man (https://web.archive.org/web/201.
