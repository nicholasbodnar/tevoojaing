Hey guys, which way should I go if I wanted to get a really nice, high fidelity jet trainer? I'd love to get something along the lines of a Goshawk or a BAE Hawk.

I had a custom built PC that my uncle had owned and given to me about seven or so years ago, it wasn't great, but I could play MS Flight Simulator X on it (barely). I wanted something that would allow me to play most games for the next couple of years, but mainly wanted to play Arma, FSX, and a few others. One of the major problems was placement of the computer itself. My room's layout posed a problem, because no desk would fit in my room. So I began a project to accommodate my future computer.

I haven't smiled so big since I was kid loading up FSX the first time. I had the DK2 and it was cool in DCS but it was not practical. I could not read gauges or the HUD without leaning in or straining. CV1 fixes all these things to a point. With the DK2 I played DCS for a few hours and never touched.

Hello everyone, I'm getting ready to embark on my second ever build. The intended use will be primarily running flight simulators, such as Prepar3d and DCS World but I enjoy my fair share of other games as well. Also I want to overclock my system as far as it can go. In the flight sim community it's claimed that FSX/P3D run best on Intel quad core CPU's and NVIDIA GPU's; I don't know if it's totally true but I won't want to risk it.
